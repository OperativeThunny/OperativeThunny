- 👋 Hi, I’m @OperativeThunny
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud migration strategies, ansible (I LOVE Ansible!), docker, k8s, and I am a well versed programmer/developer. I am now a DevOps Engineer (maybe? I'm not really sure what to call me), and I was previously a web developer/web administrator for a long time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react and .net6, and learning the amazing ingress controller/reverse proxy Traefik which I am finding great! It can do a lot of what the F5 BIG-IP can do that I use it for and it has plugin support so I can write some golang yay dev ops! Looking into learning the Rust programming language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that will teach me skills and technologies that I don't currently know.
