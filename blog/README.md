# My Personal Blog

[![Profile Picture aka PFP](https://example.com/image.png)](https://example.com/)

This is my personal blog, where I write about my thoughts and experiences on a variety of topics. I hope you enjoy reading it!

## About Me

My name is @OperativeThunny, and I am a Site Reliability Engineer, but I think DevOps Engineer suits me most for what I am doing currently. My actual job title is very general/generic and doesn't really describe exactly what I do - Information Technology Specialist.

I am passionate about computer security, novel coding techniques and procedures, gaming (especially Rust as of late), and I love to share my thoughts and experiences with others.

## Blog Posts

I write new blog posts every week. You can find a list of all my blog posts here:
