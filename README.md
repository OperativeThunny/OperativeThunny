- 👋 Hi, I’m @OperativeThunny
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud migration strategies, ansible (I LOVE Ansible!), docker, k8s, and I am a well versed programmer/web developer. I am now a Senior Systems Development Engineer, and I was previously a web developer/web administrator for a long time.
- 🌱 I’m currently ~~learning~~ ~~react and .net6~~, ~~and learning the amazing ingress controller/reverse proxy Traefik~~, becomming a boss with Python web development using FastAPI and HTMX, which I am finding great! ~~Traefik can do a lot of what the F5 BIG-IP can do that I use it for and it has plugin support so I can write some golang yay dev ops~~! ~~Looking into learning the Rust programming language.~~ maybe zig? idk I really liked C in college. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that will teach me skills and technologies that I don't currently know.
