I'm going to write posts here using an 80 character column limit even though
the document is going to be rendered with a markdown renderer, so a column 
limit doesn't even matter. But, I think it would be cool to write these text
file based posts with the 80 column limit as a throwback to the oldschool
text files that were floating around the internet in the early 2000's, where at
that time, they were oldschool even then. I have some nolstagia for my 
childhood where we just got internet and I was exploring the internet at that
time. 

However, a cooler idea I just thought of for these markdown based blog posts would be to use a Makefile and then apply a utility to the markdown files to limit the line length to wrap at 80 columns instead of bothering with keeping track of th eline length and when to hit return manually. That will allow the freeflowing internal narrative that I want to puke into these text files to flow.
