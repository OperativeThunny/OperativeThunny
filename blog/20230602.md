# 2 June 2023

I was going to write a blog post here talking about my day, but I didn't feel 
super inspired to follow through. I got as far as making the file and header,
but I didn't go further. This little paragraph is being written on the 11th
of June, 2023. I considered deleting this entry and file outright when I went
to write the 11 June post, but I figured it would be better to keep the file
and add this explanation to document I intended to write a blog post, however
I did not.
